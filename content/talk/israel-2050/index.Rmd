R is an amazing tool for preparing and visualizing data. As political activists we want to provide our readers with information that will influence and motivate them to act. The talk outlines how I believe R can empower individuals to work with data in an efficient and aesthetic way.   
You can find a static example of knitting a document with parameters under the folder 'rmarkdown_eg' in the code repository. Rmarkdown's ability to render documents is something I found extremly advantageous over other programs such as SPSS, a statistical program commonly taught in the social science. The slides were given to a group of fellows of the program [Israel-2050](https://israel2050.co.il/) which I was a member of in 2017. This is not a hands-on learning session but an exposure to some of R's abilities I find fascinating and helpful for those wanting to work with data effectively.
