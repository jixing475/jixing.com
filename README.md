### Amit Levinon's website

Hey there!

Welcome to the repository of my website [www.amitlevinson.com](https://amitlevinson.com/)   

The website was built with the following:  

* `R` programming language + `{blogdown}` package and [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)  

* Using the [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/)  

* Files are stored on GitHub (in this repository) and the site is deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free  
* CSS is adapted from [Allison Hill's](https://alison.rbind.io/) amazing website and from [Connor Rothschild's](https://www.connorrothschild.com/post/animate-hugo-academic/) fantastic post to animate your home page.
