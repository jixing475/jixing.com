&lt;p&gt;R is an amazing tool for preparing and visualizing data. As political activists we want to provide our readers with information that will influence and motivate them to act. The talk outlines how I believe R can empower individuals to work with data in an efficient and aesthetic way.&lt;br /&gt;
You can find a static example of knitting a document with parameters under the folder ‘rmarkdown_eg’ in the code repository. Rmarkdown’s ability to render documents is something I found extremly advantageous over other programs such as SPSS, a statistical program commonly taught in the social science. The slides were given to a group of fellows of the program &lt;a href=&#34;https://israel2050.co.il/&#34;&gt;Israel-2050&lt;/a&gt; which I was a member of in 2017. This is not a hands-on learning session but an exposure to some of R’s abilities I find fascinating and helpful for those wanting to work with data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
